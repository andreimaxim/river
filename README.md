> No matter what you do or say or plot, no matter how you come down on us, I
> will never, ever harm you. You're on this table, you're safe... 'cause I'm
> your medic. And however little we may like or trust each other, we're on the
> same crew. Got the same troubles, same enemies, and more than enough of both.
>
> Now, we could circle each other and growl, sleep with one eye open, but that
> thought wearies me. I don't care what you've done, I don't know what you're
> planning on doing, but I'm trusting you. I think you should do the same.
> 'Cause I don't see this working any other way.

> *River*: Also, I can kill you with my brain.
